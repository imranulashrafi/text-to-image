# Text to Image Generation
An Self-Attentional Generative Adversarial Network (SATGAN) for generating images from text descriptions. The model can be trained and run by using the `SATGAN_model.ipynb` file through [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com). Architecture and experimental results are described in the paper `SATGAN_paper.pdf`. For additional information and dataset feel free to reach me at <imranul.ashrafi@gmail.com>.
